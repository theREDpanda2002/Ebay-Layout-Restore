# Ebay-Layout-Restore
I got an ebay update in early august 2023 that made the item page HUUUUGGGEEE for no reason. I hated it so within a few hours I made this CSS userstyle that makes it look like the previous 2020-2023 design.  

It is a near-perfect re-creation with little to no errors. I will continue to update it if more bugs appear.

Tested on Chrome using stylus, probably works elsewhere.

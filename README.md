# Ebay-Layout-Restore
I got an ebay update in early august 2023 that made the item page HUUUUGGGEEE for no reason. I hated it so within a few hours I made this CSS userstyle that makes it look like the previous 2020-2023 design.  

works very nice and has very few errors so far.

Tested on Chrome using stylus, probably works elsewhere.
